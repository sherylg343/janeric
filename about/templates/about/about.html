                            Eric Parsells, co-founder and president of Janeric, LLC. established Exertools in 1990. The company manufactures and distributes products to the fitness, therapeutic and rehabilitation markets. After determining that physical therapists did not want to spend time throwing a medicine ball back and forth with a patient, the Plyoback rebounder was born. The Plyoback has not only become a market leader in the field of plyometric exercise but has also revolutionized the use of medicine balls. Along with the success of the Plyoback, Exertools introduced the DynaDisc in 1993.
