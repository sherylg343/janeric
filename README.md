## Project Purpose <a name="purpose"></a> 
Janeric LLC was formed during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, with 
the goal of selling personal protective equipment in volume to organizations. 
As an established business owner, Eric Parsells approached is wife and children
about starting the business as a learning opportunity and a way to help 
frontline workers.

Management intended to develop a website using BigCommerce, but accepted the 
developer's offer to build the site for free as a final school project. The 
purpose of the website is provide a channel to sell products to all users of 
personal protective equipment within the United States.

### Project Goals
The primary goal of the website is to generate sales so the site needs to be 
user-friendly and enable both established account users and guest users to 
easily select and purchase products.

A secondary goal for the second phase of the project is to add information 
about the UV equipment that kills cornoviruses and other micro-organisms.  
Since this is a product that requires a more consultative sales approach,
the purpose of that product section on the site will be to educate and generate
sales leads.

### Target Audience
The client states that their target audience is not segmented, it is all users
and purchasers of personal protective equipment within the contiguous United
States.
